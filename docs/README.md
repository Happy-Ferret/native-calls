#Documentation

As I progress in the project, I tend to make notes every time I make a major design decision.

Instead of writing down these notes down somewhere and loosing them, I version them instead - which is the purpose of this directory.

You can open one of the markdown documents to read some of these notes.

My final individual project report is also available and you can see it in its [own repository](https://github.com/meltuhamy/native-calls-report).
