WebIDL Feature Checklist========================Listed below is the rough status of implementation of each of the WebIDL specification requirements.JS and C++ status refer to both implementing the binding and generating the required stubs using an IDL.The table is only rough estimates and is designed only as a check list of things that need to be done regarding Web IDL.| WebIDL Feature

some issues:- Javascript bindings for large integer types: JavaScript numbers are *all* ```double```s, encoded using IEEE 754. This means larger types such as unsigned long, long long, etc. aren't properly supported in JavaScript. What this means is we'll either have to not support them, or create a BigInteger class in JavaScript.- Sending and receiving binary data: right now, data is sent and received as normal JavaScript/pp::Var types. While this is good enough for some cases, it seems some more performance can be acheived if we use ArrayBuffers instead. I'll have to think about when it is best to use binary buffers. - Receiving (in C++) complex arrays. Right now, the generator will only generate arrays of 1 depth. In other words, arrays of arrays still need to be supported by the generator. - C++ array format. In C++, we receive an array as a std::vector. But would it make more sense to receive it as a pointer in some cases? For example, if we send a binary buffer of doubles, there's no point in going through and converting the array into a vector. Also, if the programmer is going to convert the vector into a float array anyway, it seems pointless and inefficeint to convert it to a vector...
