\section{Message Transfer}
This section is incomplete. Points I should mention:

\begin{itemize}
	\item NaCl allows representing data into any form. Examples are XDR or Protocol Buffers.
	\item Explain how the message format could increase performance
	\item Explain that the changing of message format is done in the client and server side stubs. This mean the message format will need to be supported in both JavaScript and NaCl
	\item Examine both XDR and protocol buffers
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Comment: } Technically, it is possible to do it all in JSON, right? Using protocol buffers for example is simply a way to improve performance.
